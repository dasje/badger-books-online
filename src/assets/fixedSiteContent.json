    "Text": "I make books. Making books is a mindfulness activity for me. I love manipulating the paper and card, and constructing the layers of both with beautiful cloths. I also love typsetting. The process of moving a wall of text into something beautifully arranged in discrete chapters, and pages, and selecting fonts and endpapers, and text decoration that really brings a text to life. All typesets I make of public domain works I also make free for use without license, so that people learning bookbinding have texts to use."
